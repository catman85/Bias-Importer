# Bias-Importer
A Java application that allows you to import Presets for Bias FX and Bias Amp offline. Simply run the .exe file and follow the instructions. 

I made this app since Positive Grid hasn't releases an offline Import Presets function yet, and many of my customers are having issues with the Installation process of my custom Amps an Bias FX patches. https://jimmypickboy.wordpress.com/ 

If you own Bias Amp or Bias FX and you are a Mac user, it would be cool if we made a Mac version of this.
