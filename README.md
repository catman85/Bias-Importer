# Bias Preset Importer


## _A Java application that allows you to import Presets to Bias FX and Bias Amp offline_.

Simply run "Bias Importer.exe" and follow the instructions. Now you can privately send presets to your friends without using the ToneCloud!

I made this app since Positive Grid hasn't released an offline Import Presets function yet, and many of my customers are having issues with the installation process of my custom Amps and Bias FX patches. Trying to troubleshoot these problems that come up with my clients over e-mail, is not fun at all.    

Try using the TestFiles for a testdrive.
After Importing your preset, open up Bias FX and look in the "Factory Rock" bank.
After Importing your preset, open up Bias Amp and look in the "Custom" bank.

If you own Bias Amp or Bias FX and you are a Mac user, it would be cool if we made a Mac version of this.
